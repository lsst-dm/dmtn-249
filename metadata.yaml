description: "The current boundaries between the Butler and its Registry and Datastore components are under strain in a number of different ways.  Failure recovery during deletion operations has long been in bad shape, and much of the current \"trash\"-based system is currently just unused complexity.  Butler client/server will require new approaches to atomic operations and managing operation latency (including caching), and RFC-901 has recently shown that we may want to move away from the Registry component providing public APIs even outside of the client/server.  The provenance system proposed in DMTN-205 can also impact these boundaries, especially if we want to extend its notion of QuantumGraph storage in data repositories to graphs that have not yet been fully executed; one possibility here is to add a third component that acts as a more graph-oriented Registry.  This technote   will propose a new high-level organization of Butler interfaces and responsibilities to address these concerns."
